# Higgs vs QCD Classification using Simulation and Machine Learning

This repository contains the full pipeline for simulating particle collisions using **Pythia8**, applying **realistic smearing**, training **machine learning models** (Random Forest and Gradient Boosting), and visualizing the results. The goal is to classify Higgs boson events from QCD background using ML, as a part of a research-oriented physics-CS integration project.
